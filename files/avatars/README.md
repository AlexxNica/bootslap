The script will check for a file here that matches format `USERNAME.jpg`.  If it
doesn't find it, it will just ignore tasks related to setting the user photo.

It should probably be square.

The default images Apple uses have recently grown to 512x512 pixels so that's
what I use (although smaller should be fine as well, especially if you aren't on
a Retina display.)
